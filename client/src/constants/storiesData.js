But not every brand has a bank of UGC to use, nor an in-house team to create photos that look organic. Which is where UGC creators come in. Essentially, these creators get paid to create UGC-inspired content for brands. And if it sounds a lot like freelance content creation, you’re not far off. In 2023, we predict UGC creators will fill a gap in the market and lead to an increase in Nano creators monetizing on social — without the need to post on their own channels.`,
